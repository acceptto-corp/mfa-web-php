# About

This is a demo project that demonstrates how to integrate your account system (users) with Acceptto multifactor authentication/authorization system.

# Setup

In order to integrate MFA Web Login into your system you need to register for an Organisation account here:

https://mfa.acceptto.com/organisation_users/sign_up

Then you can create a new application in your organisation dashboard, then you need to configure 'client id' and 'client secret' for that application in config/acceptto.yml

You also need to configure your connection string and database settings in config/acceptto.yml.
